Hello!! welcome!!!! the name's Edmund Ekott, for the most part I'm a Frontend Engineer but I do anything revolving around the web using JavaScript with the right motivation :new_moon_with_face:.

#### What I work on these days :briefcase:

Aside from thinking about my next super cool Open Source project, I work as a freelance Frontend Engineer on various projects, I also write articles about the web on a number of publications including my [personal blog](https://theninja.blog).

#### What I'm learning :book:
